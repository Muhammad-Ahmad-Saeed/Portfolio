# Portfolio README

## Overview

This repository contains the code for my portfolio website. I've structured the website into different sections and used HTML and CSS to create a simple and elegant design. Below, I'll provide an overview of the different sections and the technologies I've used.

## Sections

### Header and Headline

I've created a header and headline section at the top of the webpage. The header is styled using Flexbox to ensure it looks great on all screen sizes.

### Works Section

The works section showcases my projects using a grid layout. I've created four cards to display project details. Inside each card, I've used Flexbox to align and structure the content neatly.

### About Myself

In the "About Myself" section, I've shared information about the programming languages I'm proficient in, and listed my skills and frameworks. This section is also styled using Flexbox for clean and organized alignment.

### Contact Form

I've included a contact form to allow visitors to get in touch with me. The form includes the following fields:

- **User Name**: Visitors can input their name, up to 30 characters.
- **Email**: Visitors can provide their email address.
- **Message**: A textarea where visitors can leave a message, limited to 500 characters.

All fields in the form are marked as required to ensure that users provide necessary information.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and layout, including Flexbox and Grid for alignment.
- **Responsive Design**: The form section is designed to be responsive.
